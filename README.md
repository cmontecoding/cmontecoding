## Hey, I'm Andrew ðŸ‘‹

### I'm a software engineer and educator who loves everything DeFi and Web3.

I was previously a Smart-Contract Engineer and Core-Contributor at [Kwenta](https://kwenta.io/) (now just sometimes contibuting) and I'm currently working on a few passion projects in the DeFi space.

I am a fellow and technical writer at [Rareskills](https://www.rareskills.io/) where I write and edit about Defi, Advanced Solidity, and ZK. You can see my latest article explaining [Beacon Proxies](https://www.rareskills.io/post/beacon-proxy) and how I integrated it into Kwenta.

For more information about me, you can check out my [personal website](https://definative.xyz/).
