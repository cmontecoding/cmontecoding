## Hey, I'm Andrew ðŸ‘‹

### I'm a software engineer and educator who loves everything DeFi and Web3.

I am a Smart-Contract Engineer and Core-Contributor at [Kwenta](https://kwenta.io/) where I help integrate [Synthetix](https://www.synthetix.io/) perpetual futures contracts into the Kwenta platform and other protcol tokenomics. 

I am also a fellow and technical writer at [Rareskills](https://www.rareskills.io/) where I write and edit about Defi, Advanced Solidity, and ZK. You can see my latest article explaining [Beacon Proxies](https://www.rareskills.io/post/beacon-proxy) and how I integrated it into Kwenta.
